This project hosts two outdoors automations I'm working on.
They share a lot of code so they're in one repository.

1. "Serre" is a greenhouse irrigation system
2. "Kippen" automates a chicken house hatch to keep predators out

Both are based on an ESP8266 module such as a Wemos D1, and either a motor
or a pump / water valve.

MQTT can be used both to query and to control the systems, and
other feedback can be arranged both via IFTTT and ThingSpeak.
