/*
 * Call this module instead of time(0) or gettimeofday(&x, 0) who both freeze occasionally.
 * Currently (with a quick loop()) there's no need to make this complicated.
 *
 * In another case, this could be implemented as one process that periodically does a call
 * to gettimeofday(), and another to monitor whether it freezes.
