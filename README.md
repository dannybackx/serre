This project hosts two outdoors automations I'm working on.

I started working on them hoping to do both with one hardware type,
but I ran into limitations with the ESP8266. Therefore, the chicken
house hatch system is now based on Arduino Uno Wifi hardware.
That's in the unowifi directory.

1. "Serre" is a greenhouse irrigation system
2. "Kippen" automates a chicken house hatch to keep predators out

The greenhouse system remains ESP8266 based. I'm using a Wemos D1.
